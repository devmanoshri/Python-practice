Exercise: Python Dict and Tuples
We have the following information on countries and their population (population is in crores),

Country	Population
China	143
India	136
USA	32
Pakistan	21
Using the above create a dictionary of countries and their population
Write a program that asks the user for three types of inputs,
print: if the user enters print then it should print all countries with their population in this format,
china==>143
india==>136
usa==>32
pakistan==>21
add: if the user input adds then it should further ask for a country name to add. If a country already exists in our dataset then it should print that it exists and do nothing. If it doesn't then it asks for population and adds that new country/population in our dictionary and prints it
remove: when the user inputs remove it should ask for a country to remove. If a country exists in our dictionary then remove it and print a new dictionary using the format shown above in (a). Otherwise, print that country doesn't exist!
query: on this again ask the user for which country he or she wants to query. When the user inputs that country it will print the population of that country.
Solution

You are given the following list of stocks and their prices in the last 3 days,

Stock	Prices
info	[600,630,620]
ril	[1430,1490,1567]
mtl	[234,180,160]
Write a program that asks the user for operation. Value of operations could be,
printed: When a user enters print it should print the following,
info ==> [600, 630, 620] ==> avg:  616.67
ril ==> [1430, 1490, 1567] ==> avg:  1495.67
mtl ==> [234, 180, 160] ==> avg:  191.33
add: When user enters 'add', it asks for stock ticker and price. If stock already exist in your list (like info, ril etc) then it will append the price to the list. Otherwise it will create new entry in your dictionary. For example entering 'tata' and 560 will add tata ==> [560] to the dictionary of stocks.
Solution

Write circle_calc() function that takes radius of a circle as an input from user and then it calculates and returns area, circumference and diameter. You should get these values in your main program by calling circle_calc function and then print them
